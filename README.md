Me trying Rust out.


#### Early thought on peformences.
I have only written a solsion to one simple problem, the luck be a landlord game high score. This is importent becuase maybe this is a bad use case for Rust.

Now we have caviated our words. Rust is slow. And it looks like it is very suseptable to small changes ruining the opermisoson.
